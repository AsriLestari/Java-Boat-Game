A 2nd year university project. The brief was to make a 2D game in which you had to navigate past
moving obstacles with a boat until you got to a goal.
Also when you press the enter key visibility should be reduced making it harder to navigate.

The reset button isn't actually working properly.

Things I like about this are that you can use the cursor keys or the mouse to control the boat 
and the parameters are editable. The mouse will just point the boat in that direction and 
accelerate in that direction.

It uses friction, acceleration and angular momentum to make a reasonable model of movement. 
Also there is a sine wave super-imposed on the boats movement to make it look more like it is
on the sea.
